# TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ML APP
 In this project, I have created a model to predict the sentiment of a given tweet and also deployed the same using Streamlit.
Due to the heavy memory consumption and large pickle files >>25mb, the heroku does not process the vectorizing of the data and results are not obtained . Hence I request you to watch the ML-appstreamlit mp4 video where i ran the app successfully using local host.
