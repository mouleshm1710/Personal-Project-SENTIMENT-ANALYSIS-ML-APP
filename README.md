# TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ML APP
 In this project, I have created a model to predict the sentiment of a given tweet and also deployed the same using Streamlit.
Due to the heavy memory consumption by the heroku app, it does not process the vectorizing of the data as i am using the free tier of the cloud platform. Hence I request you to watch the ML-appstreamlit mp4 video that exist in my repo.
